# Othello-AI-Opencv


Othello, also known as Reversi, is a classic baord game which uses circular discs with both sides colored as black and white. The discs are placed on the board by each player according to the rules of the game. My implementation involves using an AI opponent against a human player with the help of Minimax Algorithm. The game is developed using OpenCV and Mediapipe.
