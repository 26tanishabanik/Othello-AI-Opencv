# Othello-AI-Opencv


Othello, also known as Reversi, is a classic baord game which uses circular discs with both sides colored as black and white. There are a total of 64 discs. 2 black and 2 white discs at the center of the board initially. One’s valid move is to place a disc in a spot that outflanks at least 1 of the other player’s discs. The corners are the best places tp gain more points. The discs are placed on the board by each player according to the rules of the game. My implementation involves using an AI opponent against a human player with the help of Minimax Algorithm. The game is developed using OpenCV and Mediapipe.
